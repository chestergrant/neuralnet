What you need to know?
how everythign is setup
What arguments they take etc.

Neural Network consist of Layers.  There is a 
special Input layer where you can set the input.
For all neural net.  The input is 0 - 100,000 or
some number to be determined in the future.
To get the neural Net to compute you need to call
its update function.  To get the output for the neural net
you need to call the getOutputVector function.


A layer consist of nodes.  It has a computeLayer function
that goes through each node an compute its output
then takes that output and write it to the nodes corresponding memory
for its designated output. Each layer takes an offset
and it's from this offset that output of each node is stored.
The input for a node must be specified through its memory location ie
the memory location of the previous layer.


#0 - 99999 Input Node
#100000 - 199999 Output of Layer 1 Node for all neural net
#200000 - 299,999 Output of Layer 2 Node
#300000 - 399,999 Output of Layer 3 Node etc.

#1,100,000 - 1,199,999 Edge memory connecting input and layer 1
#1,200,000 - 1,299,999 Edge memory connecting layer 1 and layer 2 etc.  

What I need to do, test this new structured stuff.
